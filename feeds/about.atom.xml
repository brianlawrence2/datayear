I am a data analyst by trade and an all around data nerd. I am lucky enough to have a job where I do the same kinds of things that I like to do in my free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day for the next year I will work on some data related project, and post about it here. The purpose is to help myself document what I learn over the next year, and to increase my skill set. The projects/posts may end up being anything that I feel is data related, be it statistics, Python, R, machine learning, working with APIs, building data tools, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
